# AutoML Embedded user guide

ADI’s AutoML for Embedded VS extension is designed to make machine learning (ML) model development for embedded devices fast, accessible, and hardware-optimized. With a focus on ADI platforms such as the MAX78002 and MAX32690, the extension automates the complex process of selecting, training, and deploying ML models—so you can focus on your application, not the intricacies of ML.
